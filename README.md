#Python Object Oriented Programming:
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation.
The main concept of Object oriented programming (OOP) is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access the data
# Definition of class: Class is a collection of things sharing a common attribute. It is user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created, classes provide a means of 
bundling data and functionality together.
# Definition of Object: A visible entity that provides a description of virtually anything known. Object is an instance of a class.
